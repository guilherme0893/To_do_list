# Introduction

This application is a single-page application of a To Do List based on basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Such aplication was initially developed at Trybe, during the Fundamentals Module. 

# Features

The application provides a intuitive usage as all actions are clearly indicated by the buttons. It is possible to create tasks, set as completed, remove all, remove completed tasks, and to navigate up and down in the task list. Also, it is possible to save them in the LocalStorage so the user may leave the page and not loose information.

# Deploy

For deploying, Netlify is used. The application preview can be accessed at: https://chic-cat-9900a6.netlify.app/

# Future updates

The application is planned to be refactored with React in a new repositoy.
